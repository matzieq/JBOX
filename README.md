# JBox

JBox is a tiny library and asset editor for equally tiny games. In the current version you can edit sprites, tilemaps and sound effects, export them as a data file, and develop games using the (incomplete) library.

## Roadmap

- Sprite flags
- Mget and fget
- Octaves in sound editor
- Show sprite numbers and tile numbers in the editor
- Drawing functions (rectangles, circles, pixels)
