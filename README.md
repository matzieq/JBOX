# JBox

JBox is a tiny library and asset editor for equally tiny games. In the current version you can edit sprites, tilemaps and sound effects, export them as a data file, and develop games using the (incomplete) library. The software is free and open source, provided under the MIT license, which means you can do pretty much whatever you want with it, provided that you attach to it a copy of the license and copyright notice.

## Roadmap

- Sprite flags
- Mget and fget
- Octaves in sound editor
- Show sprite numbers and tile numbers in the editor
- Drawing functions (rectangles, circles, pixels)
