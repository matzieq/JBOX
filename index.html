              >Thank you for checking JBox! Just a quick heads up: JBox is in an
              early stage of development. It's fully functional, but may include
              rough edges and bugs. It is, however updated often, and updated a
              lot, so these keep disappearing even as I write these words.

            JBox is a set of simple open source tools to create<br />
            tiny web games in Javascript
          </h2>
          <img src="assets/images/game.png" alt="Game screenshot" />
          <p>
            JBox is inspired by Pico-8, the Pyxel Engine and similar fantasy
            consoles and fantasy-console-likes. It provides a simple set of
            tools to draw sprites, tilemaps and create sounds, along with a tiny
            Javascript library with simple API modelled after the Pico-8.
          </p>
          <div class="info-box">
            <h3>Simple and easy to use</h3>
            <p>
              The tools are simple and minimal, there's not much to learn,
              there's not much in the way of setup, and you don't need anything
              except for a browser and a text editor. You can get up and running
              in minutes.
            </p>
            <h3>Constraints to fuel creativity...</h3>
            <p>
              Taking inspiration from fantasy consoles, JBox provides you with
              limited space to create your assets. With just 64 sprites, 32
              sounds and a 8x8 screen tilemap the resources are tight, but this
              also means that you won't get bogged down in details, and you can
              finish your game quickly.
            </p>
            <h3>...but you can cheat!</h3>
            <p>
              There's no code limit - JBox is not an isolated environment, it's
              just a library. You can also include multiple sets of assets if
              you wish, and JBox provides functionality to easily switch between
              them.
            </p>
            <h3>It's just plain Javascript</h3>
            <p>
              You don't need any complex build tools or advanced next-gen
              features. Just plug in the library in a script tag, along with the
              data generated from the editor and your own code. It's dead
              simple, just like in the olden days when the world was young.
            </p>
            <h3>Batteries included</h3>
            <p>
              JBox gives you all the tools you need to create tiny pixel art
              games. The game editor allows you to create assets and save them
              on your machine. The library provides basic functions for display,
              input, sounds and a game loop.
            </p>
            <h3>It's really tiny!</h3>
            <p>
              Depending on how many pictures you draw and how much map you fill,
              the library together with the assets can take as little as 6kB
              zipped. You can totally use it for

          <h2>Game editor</h2>
          <p>
            Use the editor to create images, maps and sounds for your game. The
            data is saved as a javascript file that you just embed into your
            HTML together with the library and your own code.
          </p>
          <div class="info-box">
            <h3>Use the sprite editor to draw your sprites</h3>
            <img
              src="assets/images/sprite-editor.png"
              alt="Sprite editor screenshot"
            />
            <p>
              You get a total of 64 8x8 pixel sprites and a 6 color palette. You
              can then draw them in your game by simply referring to their
              numbers.
            </p>
            <h3>
              Use the tilemap editor to create maps using the sprites you've
              drawn
            </h3>
            <img
              src="assets/images/tile-editor.png"
              alt="Tilemap editor screenshot"
            />
            <p>
              You get a total of 8x8 screens of 16x16 tiles. Use the sprites
              you've drawn in the sprite editor to fill your maps. You can also
              change the map programmatically in game code by simply referring
              to tile coordinates. Drawing a map in your game is as simple as
              <span class="code">map()</span>.
            </p>
            <h3>Use the SFX editor to make bleeps and bloops</h3>
            <img
              src="assets/images/sfx-editor.png"
              alt="SFX editor screenshot"
            />
            <p>
              You can make 32 sound effects, each consisting of 32 segments.
              There are several waveforms and special effects to spice things
              up. You can also make some simple music in the editor, although a
              more advanced tracker-like music editor is in the works as we
              speak.
